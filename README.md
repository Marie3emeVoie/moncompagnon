About

MonCompagnon App is a modern desktop app combining the speed and simplicity of React and Vite with the power and security of Tauri. It aims to provide a seamless, lightweight experience across platforms.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Vite

Backend: Rust (via Tauri)

Build Tools: Cargo, npm/yarn

Platform: Cross-platform desktop apps via Tauri

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16+ recommended)

Rust and Cargo

Git

Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows)
 (for Rust native dependencies)

Webview2 Runtime (Windows)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/moncompagnon.git
cd moncompagnon


Install frontend dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install


Install Rust dependencies (this is usually handled by Tauri automatically):

rustup update

Running Locally

Run the app in development mode:

npx tauri dev


This command will:

Start the Vite dev server (usually on http://localhost:5173
)

Build and run the Tauri backend and frontend together

Watch for code changes and reload automatically

Building for Production

To build a distributable version of your app:

npx tauri build


This creates optimized binaries for your target OS inside the src-tauri/target/release folder.

Environment Variables

If you use environment variables (e.g., API keys, configuration), create a .env file in the root directory:

VITE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here


Make sure to add .env to .gitignore if it contains sensitive info.

Access env variables in your React code using import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY.

Troubleshooting
Common Issues

Port conflicts:
If ports 5173, 5174, or 5175 are busy, Vite will try next available ports. Stop other processes or specify a port manually.

Permission denied / Access is denied (os error 5):
Run your terminal or IDE as Administrator or check antivirus software that may block file writes.

Rust build errors:
Make sure you have Visual Studio Build Tools installed on Windows and your Rust toolchain is up to date.

Webview2 runtime missing (Windows):
Download and install the Webview2 runtime from Microsoftâ€™s website.

Cleaning build cache

If you encounter strange build issues, clean caches:

cd src-tauri
cargo clean
cd ..
npm run clean # if you have a custom script or remove node_modules manually
